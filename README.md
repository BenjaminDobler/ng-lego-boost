# NgBoost

Today i got my daughter (or myself?) a Lego Boost. Maybe the best money spend ever!
So much fun and my 6 year old daugher now wants to become a programmer :-)

So anyway first thing i did when i ordered was to check out if there are any node libs for the boost out there.
I found a pretty nice one here: https://github.com/hobbyquaker/node-movehub

Getting this going was pretty straight forward so then i thought about BLE and the browser. Wasnt there something?
Right! You can now access your BLE devices right from the browser (https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web)! So i spun up a new angular project. Reworked the node-movehub lib a bit and voila - you can now control your Lego Boost directly from the browser. No node, no server nothing needed. Just browser apis!

This is just the start (5 hours after the boost arrived). Hope i continue this exploration... Too much fun!
